General Notes

7 x 6 grid generated with a for loop

Player 1 Red
Player 2 Yellow

lots of if else statements that keep checking win condition - tracking indexes

seperate win condition as a function to call



************     START GAME     ******************


What happens when Player 1 clicks START button? 
Player 1 starts first, lets say RED



*****************      GRID EVENTS      ******************

indicator moves on on mouse hover or mouseenter, according to which column mouse is in
on mouse out, so if going off the grid, then should just be normal mouse cursor

what happens when....user clicks a column?
When a user clicks a column, it should drop his piece into that column

when a user hovers across, there should be an indicator at top to show which column he is in.

It should not matter what height row they are in, that should make no difference, it's only about columns
